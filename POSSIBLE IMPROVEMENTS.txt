Possible improvements that will benefit the application but will require too much time to implement: 
- Make use of data objects.
- store images in the parent objects instead of seperating them into another database collection
- make more use of things like lazy loading to increase performance
- breadcrumbs in detailpage
- Add to homescreen as app.
